So what I told him has been summarized in this article. I wanted to share it with you. Maybe you may get some value too.
<br><br>
.
Creating a customer journey does not happen overnight. It is a lots of work, consistency, dedication and effort. People don't like to be sold.
<br><br>
Create the right customer journey for your prospects from first impression to closing deals .
<br><br>
.
Every potential customer has their pain point, troubles, difficulties, anxieties and problems and they are looking for products or services that can help them address, solve, fill them adequately and at the right time. .
<br><br>
.
When they come across your offer, it’s a make-it-or-break-it opportunity or possibility for you to showcase or tell them that you have the right solution, the right value for them . If the first impression you created in their head is right, and you stand the chance to, draw, convert your potential customer into a buyer . That first right impression will not convert itself into a selling machine if you don't do anything to take it to the next level. The reason is some may not be financially ready to buy from you that day. So know that your efforts to build relationships with them are not over. No. You need to continue nurturing them so that they buy from you when they are ready.
<br><br>
..
That's why, you have to get the nurturing process right to convert prospects into customers. Get it wrong, and they will leave and abandon you.

So I came up with six things you can do to build relationships with your leads so they convert into real customers that buy from whenever the need arises.
<br><br>
.
<br><br>
.
1. Provide your audience with educational materials
<br><br>
Your leads look to your products for possible solutions to their problems. Prove your expertise and provide educational materials such as how-to blogs, guides, comparisons, tips and life hacks they can use to address their pain points and problems. Don't think that you are sharing valuable information. Just know to what extent you can give freely. You know you stuff. So which one you give for free should be at your discretion. But per my experience, filmmakers give their best part to us and that the hook, we want to know more. So we go and watch that film they have premiered.
<br><br>
While providing that educational material, show them that you understand their problems or may be you have gone through them by yourself or a close friend has gone through it. So you know how to solve them. Show them this, and they begin trusting you. Guaranteed
<br><br>

2. Be smarter and more strategic about communicating with your customers
<br><br>
It is true that we all get annoyed with hundreds or thousands of emails we receive from brands every day. But despite being annoying, controversial and invasive at certain point, email remains a vital channel for brands to communicate with their customers. I learned how to write, craft compelling messages through emails I received daily. I model them and communicate with my clients. And it works
<br><br>
But emails are not the only means to constantly get in touch with your leads. No. You can use other ways of staying connected with your them while giving them relevant information. You can create blog posts, videos or guides and send out push notifications offering this content, coinciding with their buyer’s journey or any actions they’ve taken on that journey. Just be creative. Understanding buying customer psychology and buying process is vital at this juncture. Beware
<br><br>

<br><br>
.
3. Deploy business intelligence in your customer onboarding process
<br><br>
Sales and Marketing are constantly changing, yes evolving . The old drip sequence you’re sending to users might not be as effective, result driven as it used to be . You need to explore business intelligence in your customers nurturing process to convert more people into buyers. .
<br><br>
Think of a smarter, strategic way to send your message to your customers. You can use many marketing automation tools to help you scale and nurture customer relationships. This could be the in the way you craft your message, your new visuals, podcasts, videos, animations etc... Anything innovative, interesting that you can think of different from the old ways of doing. That will let your leads know that you are improving in your services delivery.
<br><br>
.
<br><br>
.
4. Choose and send the right message at the right time
<br><br>
The main objective of marketing is to create relationships with your customers, so you must ensure you talk to them in the language the understand the best .
<br><br>
That is why you need to identify their buying journey stage to determine which type of message you should send them. The aim is to keep your leads until they turn into customers — or even repeatedly buying from you — if they liked your product or service.
<br><br>
Personalised marketing messages will do the trick . That is where client avatar comes in. Write to one specific person like this message as a response to my friend. And because many people have the same problem, they will all feel like you are talking to them. That's it.
<br><br>
So, make your prospects feel you’re actually listening to them and know their pain points. Your emails and other messages should consistently address their problems and offer solutions through your product or service. Try different times. Morning message. Afternoon message. Evening message. Dawn message. Late in the night message. Festival time messages. Hard times message. National issues message. International problems message like Covid-19. Etc.
<br><br>
.
<br><br>
.
5. Make sure your product or service are more personalized according to the customers’ needs
<br><br>
Determine why your customers visited your website if you have one or engaged with you either on WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or Google . What do they need from you? Customize the entire user experience by discovering what they look for on from your products and services . Is it a specific product or service? Did they come there to do invoicing? Or anything other thing you can think of.
Be understanding.
<br><br>
Now, that you know it, nurture them through personalized messages, and turn them into email, Youtube subscribers, and, finally, into customers.
<br><br>
.
<br><br>
.
6. Utilize your CRMs effectively
<br><br>
Customer Relation Management is a system you put in place that helps you collect and manage customer information and interact with your them better. So use this tool to personalize your messages to your customers so they can feel you understand their needs, problems, difficulties, troubles and want to help them meet those them immediately .
<br><br>
You know, as your business grows and expands, you need to keep track of your prospects so you can constantly think of ways of getting them to the sales funnel.
<br><br>
..
.
In conclusion, remember that your potential customers become active customers after you nurture, entertain, educate them. That process starts the moment you introduce to them your product or service for the first time . Don’t waste that opportunity. Remember first right impression is the best. From there, it will allow you to continue nurturing your audience, leads through the customer journey. Communicate with them in their language, address their pain points and customize your messaging to match their buyer’s journey stage. If you do it right, you will increase, even multiply your visibility, marketability and income. Who says income says sales. Sales mean more money.
