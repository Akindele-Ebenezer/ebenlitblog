$content = "Dance can be used as a vehicle for expression. It can help tell a story, convey feelings and emotions, and connect with others and with ourselves.
<br><br>
Body movement can be expressive and communicative. It can be used as a means of self-expression where words are not necessary – the body does all the talking!
<br><br>
Everybody tend to behave differently behind closed doors. And dancing is no difference.
<br><br>
Our bedroom knows us more than we actually know of ourselves... But how is that so? You might ask.
<br><br>
Well, our private room is where we actually get so comfortable that we express ourselves to the maximum.
<br><br>
Dont you think that we all are great dancers? I think so, if only we can get so comfortable to dance.
<br><br>
When in public, most of us dance but with caution... that's why we can't show our best. Is it because we are shy?
<br><br>
For some, yes. For others, they are trying to be cautious which is very Ok. dont get me wrong.
<br><br>
But, is that not why you are regarded as a terrible dancer? when you know you can do much more better.
<br><br>
Mehnnn... That's not fair to you or to humanity! 'reason am nah'
<br><br>
Those we regard to as 'great dancers' can't even dance better than most of us... But the only difference is that they're being themselves and dancing to their best.
<br><br>
They are being REAL!
BE REAL TOO.
<br><br>
Am i actually talking about dance? NO😂😂
I cant even dance in my dreams😜😜
wondering what my wedding day would look like?😴😴(just thinking out loud)
<br><br>
Well, am talking about how we choose to approach life.
<br><br>
How we choose to approach our passion.
<br><br>
We do that SO carefully, that we cant show our best.
We are fake!
<br><br>
Forgetting that those 'bedroom moves' is what will take your spectators off their seats to applaud you. To give you that standing ovation you so dreamt of.
<br><br>
Are you ready to 'DANCE'?
<br><br>
'Lemme quickly go and learn some dance moves for my wedding day'🏃🏃
<br><br>
P.S: This content is not about dance. Its about how we choose to approach life.
