$content = "My elder brother announced and I almost peed my pants.
'Not again! I can't keep doing this every night or else I'll go insane.' I pleaded with him and he turned to me with a stern expression.
<br><br>
'You have to stay strong or do you want mom to die?' He asked me and I shook my head. Of course I didn't want my mom to die, but we have been doing this for three days straight every night at 7pm.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the windows started rattling and the doors were shaking and I gripped the pestle I was holding so tightly. I glanced at my brother, even though he was trying to be strong, he looked pretty scared as well. That was when the doors burst open with intense speed.
<br><br>
I know you all are wondering why I'm being all scared and jumpy. Let me start this tale from the beginning.
<br><br>
We lived with our parents in a small house outside town. Our mom was the sweetest and kindest woman ever, but our dad was an abusive man and laid hands on our mom every single time. Each time we tried to stop him from beating her, he will beat all three of us at once.
<br><br>
Many people advised our mom to leave the marriage, but she said she had no where to go, besides she didn't want to leave her children with an abusive man. She endured a lot at the hands of our father and ended up crying every night. it broke us as children to see her that way.
<br><br>
One fateful day, our parents were both arguing ad they usual do and all of a sudden, our dad started beating our mom and kicking her around till she was bleeding from both mouth and nose.
<br><br>
'I am going to kill you today!' he spat out as he walked towards the door  'When I get back, it's all over for you.'
<br><br>
He slammed the door and walked away. We ran to our mom and begged her to run away, but she smiled at us with bloodied lips.
'It will be alright.' She said 'Nothing is going to happen.'
<br><br>
But she wasn't fooling anyone. I could see the fear and despair in her face. We prayed and begged for someone to come save our mom. We reported our dad to one of the neighbors before and we he tried to interfere, he landed himself in the hospital because our dad beat the living daylights out of him. So since then, we've been carrying our cross alone.
<br><br>
Around 5 o'clock, a neighbor came running to our house to give us a delightfu... I mean bad news. Our dad got into an accident and died on the spot and his body got taken to the mortuary immediately. I never knew it would be so hard to keep one's self from smiling. My brother nudged me when he noticed the smug look on my face and I comported myself.
<br><br>
That night around 7pm, it was rainy and stormy as lightning and thunder tore through the sky. We were all hurdled in our moms room trying to stay calm. All of a sudden, the kitchen window and door started rattling and we all got up immediately. My mom asked us to stay behind her as we walked to the kitchen to check it out. Once we got to the kitchen, it stopped.
<br><br>
As the lightning flash illuminated the kitchen, we thought we saw someone standing at the window, but once the flash went out, no one was there. We all looked at each other we dazed expression on our faces.
<br><br>
'Mom?' I called out to her and she squeezed my hand.
'It's okay sweetie. it's okay.' I think she was trying to convince herself more than me.
<br><br>
All of a sudden with a lightning flash, the kitchen blasted open and a figure stood in the door way, dripping from the rain with a huge gash on his head. When the lightning flashed again, we saw it was our dad with a bloodied body.
<br><br>
'I told you I'd kill you today.' he said and started walking towards us as my mom screamed out.
'Stay back! You are dead!'
'Shut up woman!' He shouted at her and grabbed a knife.
<br><br>
My older brother got over his fear and grabbed a pestle and immediately our dad came running to our side, my brother hit him with the pestle and he disintegrated into dust. We all fell to the floor, remembering that humans were supposed to breathe to survive.
<br><br>
The next morning we told our neighbors what happened and they looked at us as though we were crazy and once again, we had to carry our cross by ourselves.
<br><br>
Around 7pm again, We were all lying down when we heard a knock on the door. My mom got up and asked us to stay calm while she checked the door, but we insisted we wanted to go with her. We walked carefully to the door as my mom asked.
'Who is there?' At first there was no response. We all gave each other that panicked look as my mom repeated her question.
<br><br>
'It's your darling husband of course.' Came the replied and I almost swallowed my tongue and my heart sank into my stomach as the door blew apart sending us flying to the ground. Our dad was here again this night, walking slowly towards us with a big big stick on his hand
'Told you I'll kill you!' He said and raised the log but at that moment, one of the neighbors came rushing in and he disappeared immediately.
<br><br>
We explained to our neighbor and he said we should call the mortuary and inform them. We called the morgue the next day and they said our father's body has been disappearing from the morgue for the past two nights only to be found in front of the morgue every morning. They said they'll handle it and we shouldn't worry. But we were still high on our toes.
<br><br>
That night, we were prepared for the worse. We told our mom to stay in her room while me and my elder brother guarded the door. Our mom begged us to leave her and go stay with the neighbors but we wouldn't hear it. we would never leave our mom behind. I gripped my pestle so hard that my palm hurt and I tried to put on a brave face. Although I complained on how tired I was of this happening every night.
<br><br>
As usual the windows started rattling as the wood we used to close the door hinges exploded and sprayed us with splinters. We waited for our dad to walk in as usual, but there was no sign of him. That was when we heard the TV turn on in the sitting room and we slowly walked to the door and peered in. To our utmost shock, our dad was comfortably seated on the sofa watching the TV.
<br><br>
When he noticed us, he quickly snapped his head in our direction, stood up and started walking towards us. My brother and I backed away slowly until we were directly in front of our mom's room.
<br><br>
'Out of the way brats! I'm only here for your mom.' His voiced sounded cold and murderous. I peed my pants instantly and tears welled up in my eyes as he approached. All of a sudden, I did something unexpected and our dad was even more shocked than I was. I ran in between him and my mom's room and spread out my hands as pee dropped from my pajamas.
<br><br>
'Stop dad! it's enough, don't you get it? we are never going to let you take mom. Never! You were never a good husband or father and you made our lives miserable. Even now you are dead, you are still tormenting us.' I said as my elder brother joined me.
<br><br>
'We'll never let you take her, even if we have to do this every night.' my elder brother said.
My dad looked from me to my elder brother and back to me. I could swear a smile broke on his face. He turned and started walking away. When he reached the door, he gave us one last look before he walked out of the door and disappeared.
<br><br>
My brother and I collapsed on the floor. Our mom rushed to us and hugged us tight.
'My boys, I'm so proud of you. I'm so happy to have you both in my life. You are so brave!'
<br><br>
After that night, our dad never visited again and he was buried two months later.
