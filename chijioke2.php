<br><br>
I couldn't sleep that night, my pillow was soaked with warm tears
<br><br>
I picked up my phone to call my friend but I could hardly hit a button, my hands were vibrating like tiger generator
<br><br>
Alas! How could I?
<br><br>
Me, Chijioke Otikpa..
<br><br>
I had trekked all the way from Eke amobi to Nkwo the day before, just to buy her a gift that will make her happy.
<br><br>
After buying the gift, I realised that I had used up all the money I had in my account in this life.
<br><br>
And I had to trek my way through... 🥵
I brought the gift straight to her place.
<br><br>
She looked into my eyes and said 'thanks'
<br><br>
That thanks meant a lot to me.
<br><br>
I read 300 meanings into it and came to conclusion that she was happy..
<br><br>
But then, the next morning something happened...
<br><br>
She sent me a card
<br><br>
I was so excited, I assumed it was a 'thank you' card..
<br><br>
I sha saw something that looked like '❤️' at the top of the card..
<br><br>
All the blood vessels in my head dilated, my head became warm, wow!
<br><br>
I could feel my head increase in size...
<br><br>
I quickly replied, 'much welcome, please don't mention dear'...
<br><br>
She was my first love ever.
<br><br>
I met her and instantly believed she was my missing rib.
<br><br>
I would go to sleep thinking about her
<br><br>
I'll pick up a book and read one page for 2hours.
<br><br>
Thoughts of her consumed me. I almost wrote her phone number in the space for my reg number in one examination...
<br><br>
We both had become inseparable friends... I would jokingly call her 'my own' and she'll smile and giggle
<br><br>
There's nothing I did not do..
<br><br>
Nobody told me...
<br><br>
Until that blessed day.
<br><br>
Mumu me!!!, I did not open the image she sent me..
<br><br>
After I replied you are 'welcome bla bla bla'..
<br><br>
She just sent a smiley😁, and even in the smiley, I saw her smile... Chai!
<br><br>
The next day, I started missing her again🤦🏾‍♂️
I did not understand what was happening to me,
A whole me, strong man like me..
<br><br>
Iron man since childhood.. How can I?
<br><br>
Well, just because I wanted to have enough time to look at the card and read the sweet thank you message in it very well, I postponed my important meeting to the next week.
<br><br>
I had sneaked out of my room and left my visitors in there, I went and sat down jejely in the staircase...
<br><br>
As I sat there in the stairs, I opened the image
Lo and behold!
<br><br>
Brethren, it was wedding IV.
Ah! When? How? Why? What? Where?
Haba na!
😭Tell me this is a joke.. My heart skipped 2 beats, my phone slipped out of my hand, fell to the ground floor with loud crash and the screen shattered..💔
<br><br>
I went all the way down, picked up my device and coupled it then rushed back to my room, by then my visitors were ready to go, I waved goodbye and locked my door.
<br><br>
That night, I cried my heart out😭😭.
<br><br>
I lost concentration, my appetite disappeared and I fell sick instantly.
<br><br>
I still couldn't understand what happened.
I thought we agreed to be there for each other.. Ahhh! 😭
<br><br>
I summoned up the courage to go confront her.
<br><br>
I quickly pulled out my phone and went to Google to search what to do.
<br><br>
I saw some suggestions, and saw others saying the exact opposite
I did tumbom tumbom and picked one
<br><br>
It said I should ensure its not a prank, that ladies can do that sometimes..
<br><br>
So I wiped my tears and took off like a tornado 🌪️...
<br><br>
I ran my way to her place.
<br><br>
And I asked her, 'babe, are you learning graphic design?'
<br><br>
This one you sent me a flyer, the deign is fine but you should have used another person's name na
<br><br>
Why did you scare me like this by putting your name there?.
<br><br>
The she replied, Jay, that's my wedding invitation
<br><br>
My jaw dropped in disbelief 😯
<br><br>
I broke down and asked again
How? Why?
<br><br>
She was like
<br><br>
Jay, were we really in a serious relationship?
<br><br>
I said yes, and my lips forced an echo of the same word yes, come on! How can she be asking that?
<br><br>
She fired another shot, are you ready to settle down?.... That one touch meee
<br><br>
I looked at the damsel and it dawned on me..
<br><br>
My eyes opened wide and 3 scales fell off
<br><br>
Yea, maybe I wasn't really ready..
<br><br>
I really loved her but...
<br><br>
I wasn't ready... and she was
<br><br>
So she met someone who's ready too and they've moved on. I have no right to be angry with her...
<br><br>
So I'm about to let my missing rib enter another man's house, I stood there and a flood of tears started pushing my eye sockets waiting for the final command to break forth and cover the face of the earth
<br><br>
We both stared into our eyes, I saw her eyes sparkle and all hell broke lose. I wept😭
<br><br>
I was recounting the lies I told myself
<br><br>
'I'm still young'
<br><br>
'I just need to focus on my degree only and graduate and then life will be soft'
<br><br>
'Money is not really necessary, love is everything'
Aaah...
<br><br>
There and then, I remember what my mum told one one day
<br><br>
Nwaanyị a na-ata love ata? (will a lady eat love?)
<br><br>
I realised I lied to myself, I wasn't young...
<br><br>
In fact that young boy I saw his name on that flyer was my junior in secondary school.
<br><br>
He's a Web developer, public speaker and forex trader.
<br><br>
I only played away my time and only spent much time reading only school books, depending on my parents and hoping to get the job of my dreams after school...
<br><br>
I was dead broke and carefree🥺...
<br><br>
But this one event taught me a big lesson
<br><br>
So I finally had to let go.
I could not believe it but I had to try
<br><br>
It was a period of deep reflection for me
<br><br>
I went back to my room and cried my heart out that day.
<br><br>
I didn't go out for some days, I kept thinking to myself, is this how cruel life is?
<br><br>
To let me patiently build a house from foundation to lintel level for another man to rush in, roof the house and claim it all to himself💔
<br><br>
With my red eyes, I struggled to fall asleep...
<br><br>
I was feeling sleepy and still very much alert at the same time.
<br><br>
My brain kept pushing my mouth to vocalise the rhetorical questions 'Why? When? How?'
<br><br>
I didn't even notice the mosquito that was happily feasting on my left leg..
<br><br>
Even when I saw it, I couldn't lift a finger. Maybe I had cried my muscles to paralysis...
<br><br>
The mosquito was busy getting fat and red.
<br><br>
My emotions quickly turned from sorrow to anger and just like Samson, I summoned every residual energy in me and picked up the book 'sell like crazy' that I was reading 3 days before..
<br><br>
I grabbed the book from one end and
Twak! 💥🦟
Foolish mosquito!
Nonsense mosquito!
<br><br>
Twak💥! Twak💥! Twak💥! I pounded it to powder⚰️
<br><br>
I picked up my phone again..
<br><br>
This time my hands were not so shaky
<br><br>
I opened Facebook and saw a post by one Mr Chris that was talking about me🙄
<br><br>
Though the person didn't know me and I didn't know him, but that post hit me hard
<br><br>
Well, this time, it was a life changing moment.
<br><br>
I read the short piece over and over again and wow!..
<br><br>
That post made me feel I still had a chance...
<br><br>
Not with the damsel this time 💔 but with life.
<br><br>
The post however, first delivered a hot slap to my face.
<br><br>
OK, the headline of the post was 'Young man, are you even ready to settle down?'
<br><br>
Now you know why I said it hit me hard😏... That same question...
<br><br>
He made emphasis on how as a young man, I should first focus on personal development, discovering my purpose and having a personal vision and accelerating my dreams with hard work if I really mean 'love'
<br><br>
He gave logical reasons and emphasised on the phrase 'You can't keep her waiting aimlessly' and 'assumptions are dangerous'...
<br><br>
Aha!, my eyes tore open immediately! It was as if I received an angelic ministration of divine wisdom.
<br><br>
I quickly grabbed my journal and scribbled some things down..
<br><br>
I resolved within me to sit up.
<br><br>
Ah, how can I be asking daddy for pocket money and still pursuing somebody's daughter?
<br><br>
How can I be unapologetically eating 'mummy thank ma' and be promising a damsel marriage
<br><br>
What for? That's inhuman
<br><br>
So I called myself for a serious meeting.
<br><br>
I looked at my bookshelf, only anatomy, physiotherapy kiniko kiniko..
<br><br>
I checked my account balance again, ah! Mess up!
<br><br>
It dawned on me once more, I needed CLARITY, I needed to GROW!
<br><br>
I knew I had short-changed my dreams by being carefree and dependent but now, I was ready to fight!
<br><br>
I was ready to take the bull by the horn...
<br><br>
I can't afford to find another beaury that someone will come and kidnap from me...
<br><br>
I started to hunger for independence!
<br><br>
The power of just one Facebook post...
<br><br>
I read it and saw an offer at the end...
<br><br>
He made an offer for anyone interested to join his inner circle mentorship program...
<br><br>
I couldn't resist it, I felt I had seen the one who knows all my problems and has clues that will help me solve them
<br><br>
I had found him, I had found a mentor.
<br><br>
My last card was 8k but the cost of his mentorship program was 50k...
<br><br>
But I decided to take a step of faith...
<br><br>
I slid into his dm and asked if I could pay via installments.
<br><br>
He agreed!
<br><br>
That means I could split the payment in parts and pay 5k monthly till I complete it.
<br><br>
I felt like I had discovered gold.
It felt like I had won a lottery and hit jackpot💥 so I jumped in...
<br><br>
I followed his teaching and that was my long walk to clarity, freedom and abundance.
<br><br>
His first teaching in his inner circle broke me to pieces.
<br><br>
He installed sense APK files into my head by force.
<br><br>
I was literally shaking and pacing my room while following the session.
<br><br>
MY LIFE CHANGED!
<br><br>
He held our hands for a couple of months so I quickly grew to become an expert in my chosen field.
<br><br>
In one of the sessions in the inner circle, he made mention of 5 ways to make money from any skill.
<br><br>
That information was goldmine.
<br><br>
I had been waiting for such all my life but no one ever gave me such.
<br><br>
I listened to that session over and over and over again.
<br><br>
Not just did it give me the motivation to start, it gave me the right knowledge and clarity
<br><br>
So I applied one of the concepts, I created my first digital product, used a simple strategy he taught us and got so many people to purchase my book
<br><br>
I made my first 5 figures, then 6 and then 7...
<br><br>
He also made mention of smart investing so I took heed and bought lands and invested in stocks and cryptocurrency
<br><br>
That was my major epiphany!
<br><br>
Ah, you need to see me dancing to the bank each time..
<br><br>
I changed my wardrobe, bought a cruise Jeep, built a very gigantic house in my home town...
<br><br>
Fast forward to today,
<br><br>
I can boldly say
<br><br>
I'm now living life with clarity, living out my purpose and making money doing what I love.
<br><br>
All because I read a Facebook post by Mr Chris
<br><br>
All of a sudden one damsel started entering my eyes...
<br><br>
At this point, I'll like to finally break to you that this is just me practicing story telling to pass a valid lesson especially for the guys in my network.
<br><br>
This story is purely fiction and any resemblance with a real character is a mere coincidence.
<br><br>
And there's a small plot twist. The Chris in the story is actually short for Christian and that's my middle name. 👍🏽Chijioke Christian Otikpa😁
And as a clarity coach and mentor, I help people move from confusion to clarity with life and career.
I advocate that young men should more than romantic relationships, seek financial confidence, have a grasp of their life visions and gain independence.
<br><br>
I really hope the moral lesson of the story was picked and please rate my story telling skills, I just gave it a spontaneous try😅
<br><br>
It's pure FICTION oh!
<br><br>
Na just lesson I wan pass with my story telling skills.
<br><br>
Make person no go snatch your damsel before your eyes🙏🏽😅
<br><br>
Have a wonderful day y'all 🤗
<br><br>
Oh!
about the picture, I downloaded it from Google, I love Google.
One day one day, I will post my own
<br><br>
I'm open to connecting with great minds here or anyone who needs my help.
<br><br>
I remain
