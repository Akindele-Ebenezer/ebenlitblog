								<h2>MY SON MUST DO MEDICINE</h2>
								<h4>7/3/2021</h4>
								<h4>Chijioke Otikpa</h4>
								<p>Let me tell you a short story. Vitalis was good in science from secondary school but he had always admired and loved teaching all through his life. Unlike other children his age, he loved watching documentaries of great teachers and even taking notes while watching, he had this dream of building his own school one day. But! His dad said he must study medicine.. His mum forced him to apply for medicine.. His dad once caught him watching a documentary video he bought from his savings, but daddy confiscated it and broke it into pieces. Prak! Prak! Prak!</p>

								<h4>Samuel Jeremiah</h4>
								<p>Raising incense with his words,
								His tongues becoming a cloven fire,
								Communing with the consuming fire,
								His eyes a viscuos fiery blazing furnace,
								His face fierce and scary,
								The flames of fire evolving out of them,
								The watchman ready to die at his post.
								With the blood of others he was designed,
								Decorated with their bloodstain.</p>

								<p>People on Mark's villa! Not those that will come here to diss me. I'm referring to those that supported me when I had a deadly war with my landlady and are still supporting me now. Am I not done for? Just two months pregnancy and all these is happening. I don't think I can take it anymore. I know some of my enemies will say I still have seven months to suffer but it is well.
