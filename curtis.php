$content = "You said you’d always protect me<br>
But it was I that protected you<br>
As I lay here naked as can be<br>
While the armour remains on you<br>
<br><br>
You said together we’d always fight<br>
But even that couldn’t come true<br>
As I was left defenceless with a knight<br>
Who could only truly care about you<br>
<br><br>
You left me completely unprotected<br>
Though I gave everything to you<br>
And now I’m wounded and rejected<br>
With nothing else left for me to do<br>
<br><br>
I thought we’d wear the amour together<br>
But apparently that was wrong<br>
For you couldn’t share with one another<br>
As I lay here now, helplessly gone<br>
<br><br>
Though I loved you with every breath<br>
That couldn’t be enough for you<br>
Or else I wouldn’t be facing death<br>
Lying in these arms of the one untrue<br>
<br><br>
You have destroyed every fibre in me<br>
Leaving me defenceless to fight<br>
And now all you will ever be<br>
Is just the coward dressed as a knight<br>
<br><br>
You said you’d always protect me<br>
But it was I that was left here to die<br>
And as I lay here, helpless as can be<br>
You should ask yourself the reason Why??<br>
<br><br>
C. Raynard.";
