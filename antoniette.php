Right now is just only<br>
A temporarily pain of life.<br>
<br><br>

You'll getting better<br>
And getting much stronger<br>
Than you used to be.<br>
<br><br>

Just feel the pain<br>
Until it heals the wounds<br>
That you carry through life.<br>
<br><br>

Everything is going to be okay<br>
At the right and perfect time<br>
Trust in the Lord who still builds you up<br>
<br><br>

Like...Right now.<br>
<br><br>
