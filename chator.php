Where life was beyond the realm
Shared in sections and themes
And every spirit had a team.
<br><br>
There was neither poor nor rich
You didn't have to switch
Nothing was beyond your reach
Even the animals seem to teach.
<br><br>
Snake and adders it lacked
Everyone's got your back
No stepping on each others mark
The finest color was absent black.
<br><br>
There was no wrong and no right
You have your civil freedom to write
All nature sings of was light
Indeed, it was a world with might.
<br><br>
Unfortunately soon, I awoke
In the real world where everything broke
The combinations of fire and smoke
And my mouth was held in a stroke.";
